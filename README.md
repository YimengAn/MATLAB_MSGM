The model utilizes both quarterly and monthly economic-energy indicators as input.

## Background
Forecasting annual $CO_2$ emissions is a crucial task for understanding and addressing environmental challenges. Traditional forecasting models often rely solely on annual data, which may not capture the nuances of short-term fluctuations in economic and energy variables. The Mixed-frequency Data Sampling Grey System Model addresses this limitation by incorporating both quarterly and monthly data, providing more accurate and timely predictions.

## Features
- Utilizes quarterly and monthly economic-energy indicators for improved forecasting accuracy.
- Implements a Grey System Model to handle mixed-frequency data effectively.
- Supports forecasting of annual $CO_2$ emissions in China.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Prepare the quarterly and monthly economic-energy indicator data.
3. Use the provided code to implement the Mixed-frequency Data Sampling Grey System Model.
4. Analyze the forecasted annual $CO_2$ emissions in China based on the model's predictions.
